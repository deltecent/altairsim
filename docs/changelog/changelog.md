# Changelog

Every release of **altairsim**, newest first. Each entry is the short version — what you can
do here that you could not do in the release before it. The User Manual describes the program
as it is now; this document is the record of how it got there.

---

## 0.3.0

**0.3.0 adds no machines and no boards. It changes one thing, and it is the thing the manual
has described all along: the copy you download now opens the video window.**

### The window the manual documents is finally in the package

Every release through 0.2.0 shipped a **headless** binary. SDL3 was not compiled into it, so
the VDM-1 and Sol-20 windows the boards and configuring chapters describe at length could not
open from anything you were handed — the machines ran, and drew nothing. `SHOW VERSION` said so
in a row nobody had reason to read:

```
altairsim> SHOW VERSION
  altairsim  0.3.0
  video      SDL3 -- windowed        <- 0.2.0 and before, the download read: none -- headless
  commit     v0.3.0
  tree       clean
```

0.3.0 is the first release whose downloaded package reads `SDL3 -- windowed`. Run `altairsim
sol20`, and a window opens. That is the headline, and most of the rest of this entry is how it
was made true on every platform at once.

### Nothing to install, on any of the four

The packages are built on the hardware they target now, rather than assembled by CI, and SDL3
is **linked statically into the binary**. So there is no `SDL3.dll` to sit beside the `.exe`,
no `.framework`, no `libSDL3.so.0`, and nothing to install before the program runs — the claim
altairsim has always made for itself is now true of its video too. On Windows the C runtime is
static as well, so a clean machine that has never had a compiler on it runs the `.exe` with no
Microsoft redistributable to chase.

The one visible cost is a single extra file in the archive — `LICENSE-SDL3`, SDL3's zlib
licence, because SDL3's code now travels inside the binary and its licence travels with it.

### macOS ships as two builds, each tested on its own hardware

0.2.0 shipped one *universal* macOS archive. 0.3.0 ships two — `altairsim-0.3.0-macos-arm64`
and `altairsim-0.3.0-macos-x86_64` — and the reason is honesty, not size. The universal
binary's Intel half had been built and tested by nobody, because the machine that produced it
was Apple Silicon; the previous two releases said so in their own notes. Each of the two
archives is now built **and** run on the architecture it targets, so the Intel download is
exercised on an Intel Mac before it ships. Take the one that matches your Mac; `altairsim
--version` and the download filename both name the architecture.

### Windows, proven end to end

The Windows package is built with MSVC, links SDL3 and the C runtime statically, passes the
full test suite on the machine that builds it, and opens a real VDM-1 window that a person has
sat in front of. `dumpbin /dependents` on the shipped `.exe` shows system DLLs only — no
`SDL3.dll`, no `VCRUNTIME140`. It is held to the same bar as the other three, and it is no
longer an asterisk on the release.

### The four downloads

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | `altairsim-0.3.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `altairsim-0.3.0-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Linux x86_64 | `altairsim-0.3.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x86_64 | `altairsim-0.3.0-windows-x86_64.zip` |

Each holds the program, this changelog, the **User Manual**, `USING-ALTAIRSIM.md`, both
licences, and `examples/` — four machines that boot, media included. Unzip it and run it;
nothing needs fetching first.

### What did not change

The simulator itself is byte-for-byte the machine 0.2.0 was — the same sixteen machines, the
same boards, the same two CPU cores. The holes named in the manual's introduction are still
holes: no snapshot, no replay, the six reserved monitor verbs still reserved, still no audio.
Everything that moved is in the box the program arrives in.

## 0.2.0

The second release. It added machines and made the video window behave like a window — but
note that the packages were still **headless** (see 0.3.0): everything below was true of a
build made *with* SDL3, which is not what the archives carried until 0.3.0.

### Three more monitors that boot from a bare command line

`amon`, `acuter` and `cdbl` became machines, so Martin Eberhard's Altair ROMs boot by name —
nothing to fetch, nothing to mount:

```
altairsim amon          AMON 3.1 in a 4K EPROM at F000 -- a full-featured Altair monitor
altairsim acuter        ACUTER at F000 -- CUTER on a plain Altair, driving a terminal
altairsim cdbl          the default machine, with the Combo Disk Boot Loader in the socket
```

The ROM images shipped in 0.1.0 already; what was new is that each got a machine built around
it — the whole distance between shipping an image and being able to run it. `hdbl` was
deliberately left out: it boots an 88-HDSK hard disk, and there is no 88-HDSK board here.
**Sixteen machines** became built in.

### The video window behaves like a window

- **It does not steal the keyboard when it opens.** The terminal keeps the keys while you type
  at the monitor prompt; `SET DISPLAY focus=on` hands them to the guest, stopping it hands them
  back.
- **It is named after the machine**, so `sol20` and `vdm1` are two windows you can tell apart.
- **It is sized to fit the screen it opened on**, and **arrows and HOME reach the guest**.
- **Closing it stops the guest**, instead of leaving a machine running with nothing to draw on.

Two of those were bugs worth naming: typed input could lag a whole frame, and the VDM-1 could
repaint hundreds of times per emulated millisecond. Both gone. The VDM-1's cursor now blinks on
the board's own oscillator — wall-clock time, as the hardware did.

### Disk BASIC, and smaller things

- `examples/diskbasic` boots **Altair Disk BASIC 4.1** off a floppy, media included — a fourth
  worked example alongside CP/M, cassette BASIC and the Sol-20.
- A binary now names the commit it was built from: `SHOW VERSION` and `--version` carry it, so
  a report against a nightly or a CI artifact can be traced to the code that produced it.
- `writeprotect` is accepted wherever `readonly` is, in machine files and at `SET`.
- The manual and the program say **board**, not card.

## 0.1.0

The first release — a simulator for the MITS Altair 8800 and the S-100 bus, in C++20, with
**nothing to fetch**: the TOML parser, the JSON encoder and the line editor are all in-tree, so
a fresh clone builds with a C++20 compiler and CMake and no network.

### Two validated CPU cores

Both cleared their gate before a single board was built on them, and for the release the
exercisers were re-run on all three platforms — roughly 15 billion instructions each:

- **8080** — TST8080, 8080PRE, CPUTEST, 8080EXM
- **Z80** — ZEXDOC, ZEXALL

### Fourteen boards, thirteen machines

88-2SIO · 88-SIO · 88-ACR · 88-DCDD · 88-MDS · 88-VI/RTC · 88-C700 · front panel · memory ·
8080 CPU · Z80 CPU · VDM-1 · Processor Technology Sol-PC · Host Bridge (our own design).

CP/M 2.2 cold-boots from both 8-inch and 5.25-inch disks. MITS 4K and 8K BASIC and Programming
System II load from cassette — including **real `.WAV` audio, played and recorded**, at measured
CUTS/ACR parameters.

### Debugging, and an assistant that can drive it

Breakpoints, watchpoints, tracepoints, conditional breaks (`BREAK … IF`), execution history,
and symbolic reference loaded from `.PRN` and `.SYM` files — DDT and SID run under it,
self-modifying RST 7 breakpoints and all. An **MCP server** lets an AI assistant drive a
running guest.
