// Milestone 1a is CLI + bus + memory, and NO CPU: the monitor is the bus master.
// That is not a limitation to apologize for -- it is the point. Every claim the
// bus design makes (a ROM that never answers a write, an empty socket that
// floats, a PHANTOM* overlay that is not contention, five incompatible banking
// cards) is testable with two boards, a hex file, and no processor. And it is
// worth testing BEFORE a CPU exists, because those behaviors differ SILENTLY:
// get one wrong and the symptom is a guest misbehaving ten thousand
// instructions later.
// The type name is the CHIP, because that is the word an operator reaches for --
// `BOARD ADD 8080 cpu0`. Nobody asks for an 88-CPU by its catalog number, and
// when the Z80 cards land they will be `z80`, which is what people called those
// too. The card's identity lives in its .md, where it belongs.
